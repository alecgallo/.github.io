## Sports
I did sports since I remember. I started doing artistic gymnastics at 7, when I was cute and bright. ![gym2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f57845d-5160-4a67-a5e2-c7908e8c4306)

For 15 years, gymnastics was my world, and the gym and team have been my home.

It's been an up and down process, lots of challenges, falls, but gymnastics gave me also happiness. Throughout those years, I competed in League 2 for teams, where the camaraderie and shared victories created memories that still bring a smile to my face. One of my proudest moments came in 2016 when, as a junior, I won the Italian Championship on the high bar. It was a moment of triumph that I’ll never forget. ![photo_5936175554111849601_x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2014b3c3-2633-4e67-84ae-12cd50882872)

2016 was a great year as I participated to the  4th Autumn Gym Cup, competing against internationals teams and athletes, that are currently at the top level in gymnastics. 

These experiences fueled my passion for gymnastics, but after many years, I felt it was time to explore new horizons. In 2020 I felt it was the right time to stop and moving forward to new experiences. I completed my bachelor's studies and I wanted to study abroad, focusing fully on the academic career.

When I left gymnastics in the summer of 2020, I missed doing sports daily. That same summer, I stumbled upon Haruki Murakami’s book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running."  I didn't really understand how people do like running, so I started out of curiosity. And, it was actually quite fun! I found joy in the simplicity and rhythm of running. Now, in 2024, I’m still lacing up my shoes 4-5 times a week, running in Konstanz's forest. 

Recently, I’ve also taken up swimming. While I’m far from being an expert, I’m proud to say that I can stay afloat!


## Volunteering and travelling

In the summer of 2020, after completing my bachelor’s degree, my plans to enroll in a master’s program were delayed due to the pandemy, and I found myself at a crossroads. I wasn't able to defende my thesis before the start of the master in Spain, and nwither allow to enrol. So I decide to take a gap year. With a €20 flight ticket in hand, I moved to Chios, Greece, in August 2021. What was meant to be a one-month volunteering stint, with poor English skills and no real plan, turned into an unforgettable year of growth and full of great people and experiences.

On Chios, I worked with both children and adult refugees, teaching English, collecting rubbish in the Vial Camp, and distributing clothes. Every day was a new challenge, but it was also a chance to connect with people from all over the world and make a tangible difference.(https://www.drapenihavet.no/en/language-activities-in-kara-tepe/)
  - collect rubbish in Vial Camp
  - distributed clothes
  - and work together with other amazing internationals and beneficiaries

I like to travel slow, and with fair means, ideally my legs

- in 2018 I walked the Camino de Santiago
- in 2019 I walked Via Francigena to Rome
- in 2021 I walked Via de la Plata 



## Chess

I started playing as an hobby a year ago while I was almost done with my master's thesis. After one year of playing, I can tell I'm really bad :)
But I'd love to play with you
