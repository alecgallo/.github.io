I am a research assistant at the [University California-San Francisco](https://autismneuro.ucsf.edu/lab-members), and the [University of Konstanz](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/ungleichheit/ueber-uns/personen/alle-clustermitglieder/gallo-alex/). 
I recently worked at [Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance (DRCMR)](https://www.drcmr.dk/index.html).

My research interests include language, communication and cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, I am passionate about how children acquire language and the behavioral and brain mechanisms involved in the child-caregiver interaction that facilitate language development during childhood in both typically developing and autistic children. During my master's thesis at the [Basque Centre on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL)](https://www.bcbl.eu/en), I explored the developmental trajectories of thalamic nuclei and their association with reading and language comprehension abilities development during childhood under the supervision of Dr. [Pedro P. Paz-Alonso](https://www.bcbl.eu/en/conocenos/equipo/pedro-m-kepa-paz-alonso) and Dr. [Amaia Carrion-Castillo](https://www.bcbl.eu/en/conocenos/equipo/amaia-carrin-castillo).


<p> In my spare time, I play chess and run, though not concurrently!
