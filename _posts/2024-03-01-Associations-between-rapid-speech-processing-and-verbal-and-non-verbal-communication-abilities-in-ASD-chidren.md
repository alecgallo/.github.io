Under the supervision of [Carly Demopoulos](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/carly.demopoulos) at the [UCSF Neurodevelopmental Assessment and Imaging Lab](https://autismneuro.ucsf.edu/).

We are investigating the relationships between rapid speech processing (assessed through gap-detection, time compressed sentence repetition, Auditory Figure Ground at 8dB test) and verbal (expressive and receptive vocabulary, expressive and receptive language scores) and non-verbal vocal abilities (DANVA face and voice scores) in autistic children.

Figure 2. Association between receptive vocabulary and gap detection scores. In blue, individuals with high or intact receptive vocabulary scores, and in red individuals with lower respective vocabulary scores.
