Under the supervision of [Carly Demopoulos](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/carly.demopoulos) at the [UCSF Neurodevelopmental Assessment and Imaging Lab](https://autismneuro.ucsf.edu/).

We are investigating the relationships between rapid speech processing (using gap-detection and rapid sentence repetition) and verbal and non-verbal vocal abilities in autistic children.
