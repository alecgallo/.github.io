This project aimed to describe the vowel system of Canavesano, a variety of Piedmontese by analysing the acoustic features (F1 and F2) of the vowels. 

Our findings were presented at the [International Conference on Experimental Phonetics (CIFE)](https://cife2023.webs.uvigo.es/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ProgramaWeb.pdf), and at the [Phonetics and Phology in Europe (PaPE)](https://pape-conference.org/programme.html#content4-4t).
