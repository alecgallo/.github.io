This project defined the developmental trajectories of 11 thalamic nuclei between 9 to 14 years of age using the [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development](https://abcdstudy.org/) dataset. We also explored the association between the development of the single nuclei and reading and language comprehension abilties over childhood.

In the Figure, different development of the mediodorsal (MD) and pulvinar (PUA) subnuclei in male and female individuals. 

Our findings were presented at the [Thalamus Anatomy and Connectomics Conference](https://www.tuebingen.mpg.de/203331/schedule). Click here [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LmTFl5UyP_zbt7ThptDlgVkB3MZlrJj7QGPG_SLw-gw/edit#slide=id.g2848b8dfe0e_0_0] to see the presentation. 

We are working on the paper!
