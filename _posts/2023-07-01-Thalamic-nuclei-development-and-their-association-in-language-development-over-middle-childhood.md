This project defined the developmental trajectories of 11 thalamic nuclei between 9 to 14 years of age using the [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development](https://abcdstudy.org/) dataset. We also explored the association between the development of the single nuclei and reading and language comprehension abilties over childhood.

Our findings were presented at the [Thalamus Anatomy and Connectomics Conference](https://www.tuebingen.mpg.de/203331/schedule). Click here to see the presentation (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LmTFl5UyP_zbt7ThptDlgVkB3MZlrJj7QGPG_SLw-gw/edit#slide=id.g2848b8dfe0e_0_0). 

We are working on the paper!
