This project defined the developmental trajectories of 11 thalamic nuclei between 9 to 14 years of age using the [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development](https://abcdstudy.org/) dataset. We also explored the association between the development of the single nuclei and reading and language comprehension abilties over childhood.

Our findings were presented at the [Thalamus Anatomy and Connectomics Confernece](https://www.tuebingen.mpg.de/thalamus), and the paper will be available soon!
